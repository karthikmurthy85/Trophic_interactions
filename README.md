# Trophic_interactions
*Main objective is to study how temperature can influence trophic interactions*

The trophic interactions are mediated by metabolism requirements of biological entities.
The metabolic rate is sensitive to temperature.
Hence temperature can influence strength of trophic interactions. 

We use 3 coupled differential equations representing the dynamics of resources, consumers & predators.
We first simulate the coupled differential equations using Holling Type 2 response.
Study the steady state dynamics - mainly concentrating on oscillations.
Then we apply Blotzmann Arrehnius equation to study the transient dynamics of the oscillations.
